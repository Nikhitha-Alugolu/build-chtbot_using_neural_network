This project aims to develop a chatbot that utilizes neural networks to understand and respond to user inputs in a human-like manner. The chatbot will be trained on a large dataset of conversations, enabling it to learn context, sentiment, and intent behind user queries.

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of conversations from various sources (e.g., customer support, social media)
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, tokenize, and normalize text data for training
3. Model Development: Train a neural network model using techniques like:
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for context understanding
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for sentiment analysis
    - Transformers for intent detection
4. Model Evaluation: Validate model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and perplexity
5. Deployment: Integrate the model into a user-friendly chat interface

Key Features:

1. Contextual Understanding: Comprehend user queries and respond accordingly
2. Sentiment Analysis: Detect user emotions and adjust responses
3. Intent Detection: Identify user goals and provide relevant information
4. Personalization: Adapt responses based on user preferences and history

Neural Network Techniques:

1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): For sequential data processing
2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): For learning long-term dependencies
3. Transformers: For attention-based context understanding
4. Word Embeddings: For vectorized word representations
